<a name="people"><h3>The People of Silicon Valley</h3></a>

<p>To begin our discussion of the people of Silicon Valley, let's consider the aggregate results from 1975 to 2014.</p>

<h5 class="lead">Figure 1: References to the People of Silicon Valley: 1975-2014</h5>
<table class="table table-hover"><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Articles</th></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Obama, Barack">OBAMA, BARACK</a></td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=JOBS, STEVEN P">JOBS, STEVEN P</a></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=CLINTON, BILL">CLINTON, BILL</a></td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=BUSH, GEORGE W">BUSH, GEORGE W</a></td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Zuckerberg, Mark E">ZUCKERBERG, MARK E</a></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=GATES, BILL">GATES, BILL</a></td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Andreessen, Marc L">ANDREESSEN, MARC L</a></td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=GORE, AL">GORE, AL</a></td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=HURD, MARK V">HURD, MARK V</a></td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=MARKHOFF, JOHN">MARKHOFF, JOHN</a></td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Maybe the biggest surprise in this table is the first row, since no historian would argue that Barack Obama is the most important figure in the history of Silicon Valley. Nor is Obama the only president on this list. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush rank third and fourth, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper into this unexpected relationship between Presidents and Silicon Valley. If we restrict our search to the eight years of Reagan’s presidency, we generate a table that looks like this.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan easily takes first place. Robert Noyce, meanwhile, one of the founders of Silicon Valley, is relegated to the fourth row.</p>

<p>Here are the four years of George H.W. Bush's administration.</p>

<p>By now it should be clear that presidents, not businessmen, occur most frequently in the data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Barack Obama is not the most important person in the history of Silicon Valley. That claim would have little backing in any source but this one. A better interpretation of the data is that Presidents frequently <i>interact</i> with Silicon Valley: they visit on campaigns, they include or exclude the Valley from their economic programs, they increase or decrease regulation or taxes or the number of work visas. Silicon Valley is an increasingly important sector of the economy, the face of high-tech, and Presidents spend much of their time regulating, stimulating, and molding the economy.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, I sampled ten articles tagged CLINTON, BILL from 1992 to 2000. Nearly every article concerned Clinton’s economic policies, and how they might bolster or destroy the Valley. The headlines read: “Policy Pitch to Silicon Valley,” “Not Everyone in the Valley Loves Silicon-Friendly Government,” and “Lesson for a High-Tech President.”</p>
<p>Government and politicians have played a much greater role in the development of the Valley than some people like to believe. The Valley likes to portray itself as a libertarian, Wild West community, free from the shackles of big government. It might be wild, and its political orientation might be libertarian, but—needless to say—it doesn’t operate independently of the government. To be clear, this analysis does not imply that the federal government has had a good or uplifting effect on the valley. It is quite possible that Barack Obama appears so often in connection with this sector of the economy because he has done so much to damage it. But the idea that an entire community has arisen independent of the government is false.</p>
<p>A few last observations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Robert Noyce appears so low on the list because nearly all the articles in the database are post-1980, and most of them are post-1990. Scholars of Noyce should not feel threatened by this analysis.</li>
	<li>Who exactly is John Markhoff, who is tagged in thirty-eight articles in the database and, according to this analysis, is the tenth most-important person in the history of the Valley? None other than a <i>New York Times</i> technology reporter. This is worth pointing out because it demonstrates one of the biases of the source material.</li>
	<li>Excluding the politicians and the journalists, every figure in the top ten is an entrepreneur: Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook; Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape; and Mark Hurd, of Oracle and Hewlett-Packard. To the surprise of no one, this analysis suggests that high-tech entrepreneurship has played a preeminent role in the history of the Valley.</li>
</ul>

<a name="keywords"><h3>The Subjects of Silicon Valley</h3></a>
<p>Let’s examine the subject tags, decade by decade, and see what they have to tell us about the history of Silicon Valley. We begin with 1975 to 1984.</p>

<p>Many of these tags are extremely vague. “Electronics,” the third most-popular tag, is only well-defined by comparison to the fourth most-popular tag, “Science and Technology.” The tag at the top of the table, “Data Processing,” seems more specific, but at first glance, it's not entirely clear what it means. I examined ten articles with the “Data Processing” tag, to try to get a sense of when this tag was applied, and gained little insight. Some of the headlines were “Taiwan Developing High Technology” and “New From Silicon Valley: The Winchester Drive.” It appears as though any article having to do with technology might have been tagged as “Data Processing.”</p>
<p>Silicon Valley in that era, like Silicon Valley now, was associated with high-tech; but while today’s Valley is concerned almost exclusively with software, yesterday’s Valley was concerned with science and technology as a whole. Already, the Valley had a special association with “electronics,” but the term "electronics" suggests hardware, not software. Computer software is absent from this list.</p>
<p>That would change in the next decade.</p>

<p>The tag “Personal Computers” was applied nearly five times as often in this decade as in the last. The tag “Software Products,” meanwhile, was the fourth most-popular in this decade. We see emerging the special relationship between Silicon Valley and the personal computer that persists to this day.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth rows are an interesting contrast. The tag “software products” appeared one hundred and three times in this decade, while “semiconductors” appeared eighty-seven times. “Software products” would be the focus of the new, emerging Silicon Valley, while “semiconductors” belonged to the valley of the ‘60s and ‘70s. In this decade, the two tags were applied with roughly equal frequency. In the next, “software products” would double in use, while “semiconductors” would vanish altogether.</p>

<p>By this time, Silicon Valley was inextricably associated with the computer. The top three tags from this period—“Computers and the Internet,” “Computers and Information Systems,” and “Computer Software”—make this very clear. The terms “semiconductors,” “electronics,” and “science and technology” are nowhere to be found. The Valley’s focus had narrowed.</p>
<p>The first tag, “Computers and Internet,” appeared three times as frequently as any other. This suggests that, in this decade of the dot-com boom, Silicon Valley was not only associated with computers in general, but with the Internet in particular.</p>

<p>Once again, “Computers and the Internet” remains dominant at the top of the table. But the next three tags are all new, and suggest another shift in the history of the Valley. “Start-Ups,” “Venture Capital,” and “Entrepreneurship” have nothing to do with technology. Instead, they constitute a certain way of doing business: entrepreneurs seeking venture capital to form their own, small companies. The Valley was no longer just a hub for producing software and high-tech products; it had also become associated with a very particular way of doing business. The Valley’s business model had become nearly as iconic as the technology that it produced.</p>

<p>What we see here is the emergence of Silicon Valley in the geography constructed by the <i>New York Times</i>. Before 2005, when an article concerned Silicon Valley, it was tagged “CALIFORNIA” nearly twice as often as it was tagged “SILICON VALLEY.” After 2005, the ratio flipped: articles about Silicon Valley were tagged “SILICON VALLEY” about four times as often as they were tagged “CALIFORNIA.”</p>
<p>What does this mean? <i>New York Times</i> articles have referred to Silicon Valley in their articles since the seventies, so the idea that the <i>Times</i> discovered the term “Silicon Valley” in 2005 is obviously false. What we’re actually seeing might be the evolution of a term from a nickname into a place name. Lots of economic regions around the United States have well-known nicknames: the Rust Belt, for example. Most well-read Americans know what the Rust Belt is, and which section of the country it corresponds to. Still, it would be strange for a reporter to tag the location of his article on the Rust Belt as “RUST BELT.” A more likely tag would be “MIDWEST (US).” The term “SILICON VALLEY” may have occupied a similar position in the American consciousness before 2005. Most readers of the <i>Times</i> knew where Silicon Valley was, but they didn’t think of it as an actual place, or a well-specified region on a map. Since 2005, this seems to have changed, and the location tag “SILICON VALLEY” is now perfectly acceptable.</p>

<a name="organizations"><h3>The Organizations of Silicon Valley</h3></a>
<p>The organization tags produce the least surprising results. The all-time top-ten list contains ten famous companies (or, rather, eight: Apple Computer and Facebook appear twice) with strong historic ties to the Valley. Six of the eight companies were founded here. The others, Microsoft and IBM, are two of the most famous technology companies in the world, and both have offices in the Valley.</p>

<p>So what can we learn from this seemingly unremarkable list? Although no company on this list is a surprise, the ordering of the companies is a little strange. The <i>New York Times</i> has been writing about Apple for many more years than it has been writing about Google, and, as of November 11, 2014, Apple was valued at about $600 billion, while Google was valued at around $365 billion. Yet Google has attracted more attention from the <i>Times</i>. Facebook is another young company that has received a disproportionate amount of attention. The number of articles concerning Facebook Inc. and Facebook.com combined is greater than the number of articles concerning Apple, even though Facebook is only a decade old and has a third of Apple’s value. This discrepancy probably suggests more about Facebook and Google than it does about Silicon Valley. Still, we can conclude that recent media attention on the Valley has, for whatever reason, focused on its youngest companies.</p>
