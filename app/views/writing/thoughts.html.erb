<a name="people"><h3>The People of Silicon Valley</h3></a>

<p>To begin our discussion of the people of Silicon Valley, let's consider the aggregate results from 1975 to 2014.</p>

<h5 class="lead">Figure 1: References to the People of Silicon Valley: 1975-2014</h5>
<table class="table table-hover"><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Articles</th></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Obama, Barack">OBAMA, BARACK</a></td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=JOBS, STEVEN P">JOBS, STEVEN P</a></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=CLINTON, BILL">CLINTON, BILL</a></td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=BUSH, GEORGE W">BUSH, GEORGE W</a></td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Zuckerberg, Mark E">ZUCKERBERG, MARK E</a></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=GATES, BILL">GATES, BILL</a></td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=Andreessen, Marc L">ANDREESSEN, MARC L</a></td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=GORE, AL">GORE, AL</a></td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=HURD, MARK V">HURD, MARK V</a></td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td><a href="/term/explore?startYear=1975&amp;endYear=2014&amp;searchType=people&amp;term=MARKHOFF, JOHN">MARKHOFF, JOHN</a></td><td>38</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Maybe the biggest surprise in this table is the first row, since no historian would argue that Barack Obama is the most important figure in the history of Silicon Valley. Nor is Obama the only president on this list. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush rank third and fourth, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper into this unexpected relationship between Presidents and Silicon Valley. If we restrict our search to the eight years of Reagan’s presidency, we generate a table that looks like this.</p>

<p>Ronald Reagan easily takes first place. Robert Noyce, meanwhile, one of the founders of Silicon Valley, is relegated to the fourth row.</p>

<p>Here are the four years of George H.W. Bush's administration.</p>

<p>By now it should be clear that presidents, not businessmen, occur most frequently in the data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Barack Obama is not the most important person in the history of Silicon Valley. That claim would have little backing in any source but this one. A better interpretation of the data is that Presidents frequently <i>interact</i> with Silicon Valley: they visit on campaigns, they include or exclude the Valley from their economic programs, they increase or decrease regulation or taxes or the number of work visas. Silicon Valley is an increasingly important sector of the economy, the face of high-tech, and Presidents spend much of their time regulating, stimulating, and molding the economy.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, I sampled ten articles tagged CLINTON, BILL from 1992 to 2000. Nearly every article concerned Clinton’s economic policies, and how they might bolster or destroy the Valley. The headlines read: “Policy Pitch to Silicon Valley,” “Not Everyone in the Valley Loves Silicon-Friendly Government,” and “Lesson for a High-Tech President.”</p>
<p>Government and politicians have played a much greater role in the development of the Valley than some people like to believe. The Valley likes to portray itself as a libertarian, Wild West community, free from the shackles of big government. It might be wild, and its political orientation might be libertarian, but—needless to say—it doesn’t operate independently of the government. To be clear, this analysis does not imply that the federal government has had a good or uplifting effect on the valley. It is quite possible that Barack Obama appears so often in connection with this sector of the economy because he has done so much to damage it. But the idea that an entire community has arisen independent of the government is false.</p>
<p>A few last observations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Robert Noyce appears so low on the list because nearly all the articles in the database are post-1980, and most of them are post-1990. Scholars of Noyce should not feel threatened by this analysis.</li>
	<li>Who exactly is John Markhoff, who is tagged in thirty-eight articles in the database and, according to this analysis, is the tenth most-important person in the history of the Valley? None other than a <i>New York Times</i> technology reporter. This is worth pointing out because it demonstrates one of the biases of the source material.</li>
	<li>Excluding the politicians and the journalists, every figure in the top ten is an entrepreneur: Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook; Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape; and Mark Hurd, of Oracle and Hewlett-Packard. To the surprise of no one, this analysis suggests that high-tech entrepreneurship has played a preeminent role in the history of the Valley.</li>
</ul>
